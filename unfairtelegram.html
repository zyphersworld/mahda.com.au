SPEEDWAY Australia James McFadden is passionate about his sport. He doesn't
like where it finds itself.

The Australian sprintcar scene is in a state of flux. Complex closures, late
finishes, track_concerns, a_lack_of_prize_money and the demise of a national
series have those most invested questioning its future. McFadden - one_of_the
world's_elite_drivers fresh from his most successful season on America's World
of Outlaws - has returned to Australia for the summer worried about the sport's
direction. The articulate competitor knows there is no quick fix, nor is he out
to question anyone's commitment. But the Warrnambool-based driver is eager to
see changes - on and off the track - which will help drive the sport forward
and encourage the next generation to invest.

"A lot of people forget we're an entertainment industry and I think once we
promote us as an entertainment industry I think we're going to be a little
better off," McFadden told The Standard.

Earlier, family-friendly finish times, an increase in prize money down the
fields and improved facilities are priorities, according to McFadden. He also
believes the return of a national series - think World Series Sprintcars -
would give competitors a goal to strive for while also providing a pathway for
the next generation. Then there's things like entertainment, perhaps a band
could play in between races? A playground for children and food vans with a
selection of delicacies from across the globe could also appeal to a wider
audience. "I think the opportunity is there. Our product is unbelievable - you
can see all the racing," he said.

"I think we need to shorten the races up, we can't be there past 9.30, we have
to make it a family sport again. "I don't watch cricket, I can honestly sit
here and say that, but I could go to a twenty20 game and enjoy it.

"We might be able to attract a different demographic (if it finishes earlier)
and then the sponsors will come that way as well." McFadden believes speedway
is putting hurdles in front of itself as it battles with other sporting markets
for its share of exposure. Promotion is king, he says. "Unfortunately times
change and unfortunately speedway in Australia hasn't changed with the times.
As soon as they figure that out I think we're going to be fine," he said. "We
need to get some more younger blood into the promotional side of things, into
the way speedways are run, into the way the formats are. "I think once we do
that, without being disrespectful to the people who built the sport to what we
know now, once we work together, it will be a lot better. "There's a lot of
things that are done the same way they were done in the '90s and that's not the
way our teams are run anymore. "You can look in the pits and there's five or
six hundred thousand dollar operations and that wasn't like that back then. "I
think team-wise, driver-wise (people) have stepped their presentation up. I
think 60 to 80 per cent of cars in the pits are as good as an outlaw car in
America." Sprintcar racing can often stretch from 5pm into the early hours of
the morning with weather and crashes pushing programs out. Tyres can cost up to
$600 each and sometimes prize money won't even cover that.

"It is so expensive over here right now with the way the dollar is. We have to
look at formats, whether that's a tyre rule or a different way to keep the cost
down," McFadden said. "The promoters need to make money for us to make money.
It works hand in hand but right now I don't think the races pay enough to cover
the cost of one tyre, let alone four. "It doesn't need to be $20,000 to win
every race but it needs to at least pay enough for someone to pay for a set of
tyres.

"I don't see a lot of the tracks going out there and chasing big sponsorship
money and I don't think there is any reason why us as a sport shouldn't be able
to attract big organisations." McFadden has a newfound appreciation for the
media and promotional side of the sport, having linked up with Warrnambool's
Tim Hodges and his Hodges Motorsport team for the first time last summer.
Hodges is a producer atFox Footy and knows the inner workings of the media
game. McFadden said the sprintcar industry needed to know how to sell itself.
"I have been in this sport a long time and I can put my hand up and say I was
just going through the motions and doing it and was earning a living," he said.
"But I wish I knew what I do now five, six, seven years ago and I could have
built my brand a lot bigger and made it more of a successful career in winnings
and being able to make a living out of racing. "I think a guy like Jock
(Goodyer) or Lockie McHugh who are racing 40 times a year should be able to
earn enough money to buy a house and I know if you're not winning those races
you're not going to be able to do that." Track surfaces are another point of
contention at present. McFadden's home-track - Allansford's Premier Speedway,
the home of the Flying Horse Bar and Brewery Grand Annual Sprintcar Classic -
has found itself in the firing line from drivers. Goodyer - one of the
competition's rising stars -labelled_it_"treacherous"after its season-opener in
early November. McFadden knows there "is a science" to it. "You're never going
to keep everyone happy, that's the number one rule in sprintcar racing and dirt
tracks," he said. "There's normally one happy guy and that's the guy who wins
the race. "But at the end of the day I think Premier need to do a lot
different. I think they might get a couple of races that are good and then it
gives them false hope for the next one." McFadden said too many variables were
at play at Premier.

"It's not as easy as changing the surface and it's all good. It's probably one
of the skinniest tracks we race on and the dirt on it creates a monster," he
said. "When they get it right, it's great. But the percentage of getting it
right is pretty tough for them.

"I hope Premier start to listen and take notes from people. They have a lot of
people in this town that have done a lot of racing - Jamie (Veal), who is also
a machine operator, myself who has been to 600, 700 race tracks in the world,
you've got Jack Lee who races and works with dirt (as an excavator). "I think
there is a lot of people who want to see the right thing happen because the
race on the weekend is not affordable for any driver or car owner to do."
McFadden is home after his most successful season on the world's best sprintcar
tour with Roth Motorsport. He had six World of Outlaws victories and seven in
total, crisscrossing the country in a campervan with partner Zoe and son Mav,
who turns three in February. "It has its great moments - the last week we were
there we decided instead of driving all the way to Charlotte and to sit in
Charlotte for the week, we drove down to Florida and parked it on the beach for
three days," he said of his home on wheels. "The other moments where we drive
40 hours and are staying in a Walmart car park, they're the nights I miss
having a home." On track it was a successful season. "Everything clicked. It
was a solid year. I sit here a little disappointed with six, I think we could
have had 10 but to be in that position and be able to win those races is half
the battle," McFadden said. "The plan is to go back, whether we do or not I am
not sure. It is still up in the air right now. "You have to have the right team
and everyone surrounding you otherwise you're wasting your time. "As long as
all those factors are right I'd definitely want to go back and have another go
at it."

There was one blight - a four-race ban for a tyre issue. It still doesn't sit
right with McFadden.

"It was a tough deal. We as a team did a lie detector test and we all passed
that," he said.

"We all passed everything to say we didn't do it. I am not saying the tyre on
the car wasn't illegal but our team itself didn't purchase the tyre knowing it
was illegal and we didn't alter the way the tyre was chemically at all.
"They're the guys I trust with my life for 80 nights of the year and if they
said they didn't do it then I believe them."

McFadden will launch his Australian season in Max's Race at Premier Speedway on
December 16, 2023.
